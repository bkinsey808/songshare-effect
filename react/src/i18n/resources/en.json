				"{{appName}} helps musicians share songs with their communities. Song leaders can share information about the music they are playing in real time with people following along on the app, including lyrics, translations, credits, and more. Followers receive song changes in real time on their own apps, during a live set and thus can gain a deeper appreciation of the music.",
				"Additionally, community members can build up a song library of their own which they can reference after the set is over and even when they are offline. And followers can use the app to become song leaders of their own if they so choose.",
				"Additionally, this app helps a musician log their practice and search and organize their song library into playlists. Playlists categorize the songs and also track an ordering if that matters. Playlists can be shared with the community or kept private for organizational purposes.",
				"In this way, {{appName}} serves the needs of musicians and their communities. It vastly simplifies the process of helping the community learn lyrics to songs. It saves trees because printed handouts of lyrics are no longer needed. And most everybody carries around a smart phone nowadays.",
				"{{appName}} could be used not just for sharing songs with a community, but also prayers, meditations, and many other things. It is intended to serve the needs of all faiths and spiritual traditions."
