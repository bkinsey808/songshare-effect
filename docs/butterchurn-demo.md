# Butterchurn demo page

This project includes a simple off-desktop demo page that embeds the Butterchurn visualizer demo (https://jberg.github.io/butterchurn/).

How to use
- Open the demo page from the demo navigation ("Butterchurn Visualizer").
- Paste any Butterchurn demo URL into the "Demo URL" field and press Enter or click the controls.
- Click "Enter fullscreen" to show the embedded demo fullscreen. Press Escape to exit.

 - Use the host page controls in the visualizer to try different presets and audio sources.
 - Capture system/tab audio: If your browser supports it, the demo provides a "Capture system/tab audio" button that will ask you to share a tab or your screen with audio; the visualizer will analyze the audio stream from that capture.
